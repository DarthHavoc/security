To detect Golden SAML authentications by correlating service provider login events with corresponding authentication events in ADFS and Domain Controllers, you can use the following Splunk search query:

```plaintext
index=your_index sourcetype=windows_security_log
    (EventCode=1202 OR EventCode=1200) AND EventID="Security-Auditing" AND EventData="The Federation Service validated a new credential"
| table EventCode, EventID, host, _time
| join host [search index=your_index sourcetype=windows_security_log EventCode=4769 EventID="Security-Auditing" 
    | table host, EventCode, EventID, _time]
| join host [search index=your_index sourcetype=service_provider_logs 
    | search (service="AWS" AND (action="ConsoleLogin" OR action="AssumeRoleWithSAML")) OR (service="Azure AD" AND action="Sign-ins")
    | table host, action, service, _time]
| stats count by host, action, service
```

Here's a breakdown of the search query:

- `index=your_index sourcetype=windows_security_log`: Replace `your_index` with the appropriate value for your Splunk environment and ensure the sourcetype is set correctly for the Windows Security Event Log.

- `(EventCode=1202 OR EventCode=1200) AND EventID="Security-Auditing" AND EventData="The Federation Service validated a new credential"`: Searches for ADFS server Windows Security Event Log events with Event Code 1202 or 1200 and Event ID "Security-Auditing" containing the specified EventData. Adjust the values or the query structure if your log data differs.

- `table EventCode, EventID, host, _time`: Selects specific fields to include in the result table for the ADFS server events.

- `join host [search index=your_index sourcetype=windows_security_log EventCode=4769 EventID="Security-Auditing" | table host, EventCode, EventID, _time]`: Joins the ADFS server events with Domain Controller Windows Security Event Log events with Event Code 4769 and Event ID "Security-Auditing" based on the common field "host". Modify the index and sourcetype as needed.

- `join host [search index=your_index sourcetype=service_provider_logs | search (service="AWS" AND (action="ConsoleLogin" OR action="AssumeRoleWithSAML")) OR (service="Azure AD" AND action="Sign-ins") | table host, action, service, _time]`: Joins the previous events with the service provider logs based on the common field "host". Adjust the conditions and fields based on your specific service provider logs.

- `stats count by host, action, service`: Provides a count of events grouped by the host, action, and service fields, indicating the number of successful logins to service providers using SAML SSO without corresponding ADFS and Domain Controller events.

Make sure to replace `your_index` and adjust other fields and conditions as necessary to match your environment and log data structure.

Apologies for the confusion. The previous query I provided was just a partial example. Here's the complete Splunk search query that incorporates all the necessary events for detecting Golden SAML authentications by correlating service provider login events with corresponding authentication events in ADFS and Domain Controllers:

```plaintext
index=your_index sourcetype=windows_security_log (EventCode=1202 OR EventCode=1200) AND EventID="Security-Auditing" AND EventData="The Federation Service validated a new credential"
| join host [search index=your_index sourcetype=windows_security_log EventCode=4769 EventID="Security-Auditing"]
| join host [search index=your_index sourcetype=service_provider_logs (service="AWS" AND (action="ConsoleLogin" OR action="AssumeRoleWithSAML")) OR (service="Azure AD" AND action="Sign-ins")]
| stats count by host, action, service
```

Here's the breakdown of the complete query:

- `index=your_index sourcetype=windows_security_log (EventCode=1202 OR EventCode=1200) AND EventID="Security-Auditing" AND EventData="The Federation Service validated a new credential"`: Searches for ADFS server Windows Security Event Log events with Event Code 1202 or 1200, Event ID "Security-Auditing", and EventData indicating a validated credential.

- `join host [search index=your_index sourcetype=windows_security_log EventCode=4769 EventID="Security-Auditing"]`: Joins the ADFS server events with Domain Controller Windows Security Event Log events with Event Code 4769 and Event ID "Security-Auditing" based on the common field "host".

- `join host [search index=your_index sourcetype=service_provider_logs (service="AWS" AND (action="ConsoleLogin" OR action="AssumeRoleWithSAML")) OR (service="Azure AD" AND action="Sign-ins")]`: Joins the previous events with the service provider logs based on the common field "host" and filters for the specific service provider logs and login actions.

- `stats count by host, action, service`: Provides a count of events grouped by the host, action, and service fields, indicating the number of successful logins to service providers using SAML SSO without corresponding ADFS and Domain Controller events.

Remember to replace `your_index` with the appropriate index name in your Splunk environment. You may also need to adjust other fields, conditions, and filter values based on your specific log data.

My script



index=azure sourcetype=WinEventLog:Security (EventCode=1202 OR EventCode=1200) AND SourceName="AD FS Auditing" AND Message="*The Federation Service validated a new credential*"
| join host [search index=* sourcetype="WinEventLog:Security" EventCode=4769 SourceName="Microsoft Windows security auditing*"]
| join host [search (index=* sourcetype=aws:cloudtrail AND (eventName="ConsoleLogin" OR eventName="AssumeRoleWithSAML")) OR (index=azure sourcetype="azure:signinlogs" "body.operationName"="Sign-in activity")]

To test: 


Apologies for the confusion. I understand now that you need PowerShell scripts to generate events in your environment to validate that your Splunk query is working correctly.

Unfortunately, as an AI language model, I cannot provide you with specific PowerShell scripts tailored to your environment and log sources. However, I can provide you with a general approach and some examples of PowerShell code snippets that you can use as a starting point to generate events.

1. Simulating ADFS Events:
```powershell
# Simulate ADFS validation event
$eventData = @{
    EventCode = 1202
    SourceName = "AD FS Auditing"
    Message = "The Federation Service validated a new credential"
}
Write-EventLog -LogName Security -EventId $eventData.EventCode -Source $eventData.SourceName -Message $eventData.Message

# Simulate ADFS issuance event
$eventData = @{
    EventCode = 1200
    SourceName = "AD FS Auditing"
    Message = "The Federation Service issued a valid token"
}
Write-EventLog -LogName Security -EventId $eventData.EventCode -Source $eventData.SourceName -Message $eventData.Message
```

2. Simulating Domain Controller Events:
```powershell
# Simulate Kerberos service ticket request event on Domain Controller
$eventData = @{
    EventCode = 4769
    SourceName = "Microsoft Windows security auditing"
    Message = "A Kerberos service ticket was requested"
}
Write-EventLog -LogName Security -EventId $eventData.EventCode -Source $eventData.SourceName -Message $eventData.Message
```

3. Simulating Service Provider Events:
```powershell
# Simulate service provider login event
$eventData = @{
    EventCode = 1234
    SourceName = "MyServiceProvider"
    Message = "Successful ConsoleLogin on AWS"
}
Write-EventLog -LogName Security -EventId $eventData.EventCode -Source $eventData.SourceName -Message $eventData.Message
```

In the above examples, replace `"AD FS Auditing"`, `"Microsoft Windows security auditing"`, and `"MyServiceProvider"` with the appropriate source names used in your environment. You can also customize the event codes, messages, and log names based on your requirements.

By running these PowerShell scripts, you will generate events that align with your Splunk query. Ensure that your Splunk environment is properly configured to collect and index the logs generated by these scripts. You can then perform the search using your modified query to validate the detection.

Please note that the provided examples are general and may require customization to match the specific log format and content in your environment.

To detect certificate export events in ADFS as part of the second detection method, you can use the following Splunk search query:

```plaintext
index=your_index sourcetype=windows_eventlog EventCode=1007 SourceName="Microsoft-Windows-CertificateServicesClient-Lifecycle-System"
OR (index=your_index sourcetype="wineventlog:security" (EventCode=4103 OR EventCode=4104) (CommandLine="*Export-PfxCertificate*" OR CommandLine="*certutil* -exportPFX"))
OR (index=your_index sourcetype="wineventlog:security" EventCode=4688 CommandLine="*certutil* -exportPFX")
OR (index=your_index sourcetype=sysmon EventID=18 TargetPipeName="\\microsoft##wid\tsql\query" NOT Image="*trusted process 1*" NOT Image="*trusted process 2*" ...)
```

Here's a breakdown of the search query:

- `index=your_index`: Replace `your_index` with the appropriate value for your Splunk environment. This ensures that you're searching within the correct index.

- `sourcetype=windows_eventlog EventCode=1007 SourceName="Microsoft-Windows-CertificateServicesClient-Lifecycle-System"`: Searches for Event Code 1007 in the Microsoft-Windows-CertificateServicesClient-Lifecycle-System source, indicating certificate export events in the ADFS server.

- `(index=your_index sourcetype="wineventlog:security" (EventCode=4103 OR EventCode=4104) (CommandLine="*Export-PfxCertificate*" OR CommandLine="*certutil* -exportPFX"))`: Searches for Event Codes 4103 or 4104 in the security event logs, indicating PowerShell script block logs containing 'Export-PfxCertificate' or 'certutil -exportPFX' commands.

- `(index=your_index sourcetype="wineventlog:security" EventCode=4688 CommandLine="*certutil* -exportPFX")`: Searches for Event Code 4688 in the security event logs, indicating command-line auditing events with 'certutil -exportPFX' command.

- `(index=your_index sourcetype=sysmon EventID=18 TargetPipeName="\\microsoft##wid\tsql\query" NOT Image="*trusted process 1*" NOT Image="*trusted process 2*" ...)`: Searches for Sysmon Event ID 18 with a specific target pipe name and excludes known trusted processes. This helps identify certificate extraction with ADFSdump using the specified pipe name.

Ensure that you replace `your_index` with the appropriate index name in your Splunk environment. Additionally, customize the search query based on your specific trusted process names and adjust the conditions to match your environment and log data.
